    "# Selecting and Preparing Data for Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used for fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) is one of the most critical factors in determining the model's success for a specific task. Fine-tuning adapts a pretrained model to specialised tasks, and the dataset's quality, relevance, and preparation are essential for ensuring that the model learns effectively. This section covers the key principles for selecting and preparing data, ensuring it is ready for use in fine-tuning.\n",

    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this reading, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to define the task and align data collection with fine-tuning objectives.\n",
    "- Identify methods for collecting, preprocessing, and cleaning task-specific datasets.\n",
    "- Recognise how to split datasets for training, validation, and testing, ensuring balance.\n",
    "- Understand class balancing techniques and data augmentation for enhancing model training.\n",

    "## Step-by-Step Process for Selecting and Preparing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define the Task and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task definition:**  \n",
    "  Clearly identify the type of task (e.g., text classification, sentiment analysis, text summarisation).\n",
    "- **Success criteria:**  \n",
    "  Define what success looks like (e.g., high accuracy in sentiment classification).\n",
    "- **Target domain:**  \n",
    "  Ensure the data matches the language, terminology, and context of the intended application (e.g., medical, legal, customer service).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Collect the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Types of data:**\n",
    "  - **Labelled data:** Required for supervised tasks (e.g., sentiment labels: positive, negative, neutral).\n",
    "  - **Unlabelled data:** Useful for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning.\n",
    "  - **Synthetic data:** Augment the dataset with paraphrased or modified examples, but avoid introducing bias or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sources of data:**\n",
    "  - **Public datasets:** e.g., IMDB for sentiment analysis, SQuAD for question answering.\n",
    "  - **Proprietary data:** Internal documents, customer service logs, or other organisation-specific sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Preprocess the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text cleaning:**  \n",
    "  Remove noise (special characters, excessive whitespace, metadata), and separate conversational turns if needed.\n",
    "- **Lowercasing:**  \n",
    "  Convert all text to lowercase for uniformity.\n",
    "- **Stopword removal:**  \n",
    "  Remove common words if they do not add value (task-dependent).\n",
    "- **Text structure:**  \n",
    "  Decide between sentence-level or paragraph-level analysis based on the task.\n",
    "- **Conversational data:**  \n",
    "  Separate user and assistant turns to preserve context.\n",
    "- **Tokenization:**  \n",
    "  Use the tokenizer that matches your pretrained model (e.g., BERT tokenizer for BERT models).\n",
    "- **Handling missing data:**  \n",
    "  Fill, remove, or impute missing entries as appropriate, ensuring no bias is introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Split the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training set:**  \n",
    "  ~70% of data, used to fine-tune the model.\n",
    "- **Validation set:**  \n",
    "  ~15% of data, used to tune hyperparameters and monitor performance during training.\n",
    "- **Test set:**  \n",
    "  ~15% of data, used to evaluate the model's ability to generalise to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Ensure Dataset Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why balance matters:**  \n",
    "  Imbalanced datasets can cause the model to favour the majority class and perform poorly on minority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class balancing techniques:**\n",
    "  - **Oversampling:** Duplicate minority class examples to increase their representation.\n",
    "    - *Pros:* Improves learning for minority classes.\n",
    "    - *Cons:* Risk of overfitting.\n",
    "  - **Undersampling:** Reduce the number of majority class examples.\n",
    "    - *Pros:* Reduces bias and training time.\n",
    "    - *Cons:* Potential loss of valuable information.\n",
    "  - **Class weights:** Assign higher weights to minority classes during training.\n",
    "    - *Pros:* Keeps all data, avoids overfitting.\n",
    "    - *Cons:* Requires careful tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Use Data Augmentation (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**  \n",
    "  Increase dataset size and diversity, especially for small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Techniques:**\n",
    "  - **Paraphrasing:** Rewrite sentences with the same meaning.\n",
    "    - *Pros:* Improves generalisation.\n",
    "    - *Cons:* Risk of subtle meaning changes.\n",
    "  - **Back translation:** Translate text to another language and back.\n",
    "    - *Pros:* Preserves meaning, increases diversity.\n",
    "    - *Cons:* Dependent on translation quality.\n",
    "  - **Synonym replacement:** Swap words for synonyms.\n",
    "    - *Pros:* Simple, increases variety.\n",
    "    - *Cons:* May alter meaning or create unnatural sentences.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting and preparing the correct dataset is crucial for effectively fine-tuning an LLM. By ensuring that the data aligns with the specific task and goals, and following key steps such as data cleaning, tokenization, splitting, and balancing, you can optimise the model's ability to generalise while specialising in your chosen domain. With proper preparation, including optional techniques such as data augmentation, the model is better equipped to deliver accurate and reliable performance on the specific tasks you are addressing. This preparation ensures that the model can generalise to new, unseen examples while remaining specialised enough to perform the particular task at hand.\n"
