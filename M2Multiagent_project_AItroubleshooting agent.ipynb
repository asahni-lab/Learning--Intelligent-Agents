    "# Practice Activity: Designing an Intelligent Troubleshooting Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** You will create a troubleshooting agent in this activity. If you are currently taking the course “Building Intelligent Troubleshooting Agents,” proceed with this activity. If you are taking the course “Microsoft Azure for AI and Machine Learning“ and already took the course “Building Intelligent Troubleshooting Agents,” you can skip this activity and use that agent. Otherwise, you must complete this activity in order to move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this activity, you will design a basic intelligent troubleshooting agent that can diagnose and resolve simple technical issues. This activity will guide you through the process of setting up the environment, defining the agent’s capabilities, and creating the logic that allows it to interact with users and provide solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n",
    "- List the key components required to design an intelligent troubleshooting agent.\n",
    "- Implement basic functionality for user interaction, problem diagnosis, and solution suggestion.\n",
    "- Integrate a knowledge base that the agent can use to provide troubleshooting advice."

    "- **Natural Interaction:** The current `input()` method is basic. Using a chat interface or voice input would be more natural.\n",
